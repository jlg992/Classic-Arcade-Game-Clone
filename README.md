# Classic Arcade Game Clone

Students will be provided visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools students must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

## Getting Started

These instructions will show you how to run the application locally.

### Installing

 1. Clone the repo by running the following command from the command prompt
	 1. `$ git clone https://github.com/jlg992/Classic-Arcade-Game-Clone.git`
 2. Change to the  application directory
	 1. `$ cd /Classic-Arcade-Game-Clone`
 3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser

### Game Play


In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down (using the arrow keys). The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
